# PlanetBuilder
Personnal project to generate Sci-Fy realistics world/planetary systems

# Composition
The builder generate stellar system with stars, planets, asteroids using realistic data (stellar physic, orbital parameters)

Then it defines anomalies climatic and geologic data randomly generated and harmonized.  (life, magnetic fields, civilisations...)

It generate at last "aliens" cilivisation.

The secondary output will be color/bump/spec maps of the planets for 3D applications.

# Required Data
A set of csv 

# Architecture
rebuild in progress
14/07/19 : change to csv data source, major rework of the architecture
