# PlanetBuilder
Personnal project to generate Sci-Fy realistics world/planetary systems

# Composition
the builder generate a xml dataset describing an orbital system with realistic data (orbital parameters), climatic and geologic data randomly generated and harmonized. It generate at last "aliens" cilivisation.
The secondary output will be color/bump/spec maps of the planets for 3D applications.

# Architecture
rebuild in progress
